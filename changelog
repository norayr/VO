    * displayType
    * displaySize
    * driverName
  * Changed preferences file name from VisualOberon.res to

    this new infrastructure I'm trying to get rid of imlib and to
    get more OS independent.
  * Prefs: Loading and storing now produces indetical files.
    Fonts do not get magically enlarged anymore.
  * Fixed a bug in VO:OS:Display. Thanks to Marco Oetken!
  * Enhanced VO:Model:Table and VO:TableView to support STRINGs, too.
  * VO:Model:Value now internally uses STRING and UCS4CHAR for storing
    textual values. Note that it does not convert values of type
    String32 to integer values (can be easily changed).
  * VO:String now directly works on STRING at some places. Rest will
    follow.
  * VGD: Parser name is now of type STRING.
  * Added support for STRING to VO:Combo.
  * ViewOneOfN now works on STRINGs as label.

2003/03/02

    String8 now correctly (improvement possible).
  * Change setter and getter for application name and window title
    to STRING.
  * Added hack for setting window title where title#String8.
  * Note that all string from VGD are of type String32! Such strings
    cannot be dropped currently.

2003/03/01
  * Introduced VO:Menu:MenuBox as top level layouting object for pulldown
    menues. That now makes the preferences code work correctly so we
    can assign f.e. background to pulldown menues.
  * various changes to background handling.
    * Now backgroundObject=NIL means inherit.
    * As a result InheritBackgroundObject is gone.
    * New background object for selection as part of VO:Object.Object.
    * As a result several local apearances of selection background objects
      have been removed.
    * VO:Object.Object.CopyBackground has been removed.

  * VGD now using VO:Prefs:Parser.ValueItem.string for comparisons
    and for assigning string values where the object allows it.
    It is now possible to address the full unicode range using VGD.
    Have seen my first chinese letters on a button :-)

2003/02/26

      * Goto home directory: A+home
      * Goto root directory: A+/
    * File are now selected by double click or by pressing Return.

2003/02/16
  * Two phase text conversion using VO:Util:EscapeString and similar is
    gone. Now VO:Text.Text will do it all itself. Note, that now
    escape sequences always take place!
  * Rewrote VO:Dlg:About.
    * Now uses struct for information to make it easily extensible.
    * Uses STRING.
  * Implemented VO:Object.Object.SetMaxWidth and SetMaxHeight.

2003/02/15
  * Added methods KeyToKeyDescription and KeyDescriptionToKey to
    VO:Base:Display.Display.
  * Removed shortcut parameter from VO:Menu.Menu.AddTextItemSC. Now
    internaly VO:Base:Display.Display.KeyToKeyDescription is used.
    To adapt your code just drop the textual shortcode description from
    your calls to this method.
  * Removed window parameter from VO:Menu.Menu.AddTextItemSC. Registering
    of shortcuts to the parent window is now done more implicit.
    To adapt your code just drop the window parameter from your
    calls to this method.
  * Added VO:VGD:Menu and VO:VGD:MenuStrip. Now you can define textual
    menues using VGD. Support for submenues will follow.
  * Remove persistance code form VO:Base:Object.

    for the parent window (especially expose events) could be
    lost.
  * Fixed menu handling bugs with sub menues. Simplified menu code.
  * Added new demo MenuTest.

2003/02/13
  * Renamed VO:Base:Adjustment to VO:Model:Adjustment.

2003/02/12
  * A number of optimisations to the VO:Menu code.
    * Important!
      Menues connected to a MenuStrip now send the SelectionMsg
      via the MenuStrip and not the topmost window. So please change
      your code to do AddHandler or Forward for message catching fromt he
      menu to the menustrip.

      For menues not connected to a strip (popup menues) everything still
      is the same :-)
  * Removed the SetInputFocus call in VO:OS:Display.Window.GrabOn.
    It is unecessary and avoids focus changed for popup windows.

2003/02/11
  * Adapted to oo2c 2.0.5.
  * Changed API of VO:Base:Display.Display.AddChannel and Co.
  * Fixed bug in VO:Text. Fontchanges were reseted on style changes.

   "features" while loading a font.

2003/02/01
  * Changed font handling system. Now VO allways loads the default fonts
    with Unicode font encoding ("iso10646-1"). Non-unicode strings
    will be converted to unicoded string using oo2c unicode codecs and
    then printed.

  * VO:Text now internally uses STRING for storing text. Expect other
    objects and models to follow.

2003/01/26

  * Added demos/FormDemo1.

2003/01/05
  * Rewrote VisualPrefs dialog.
    * Dropped FrameGroups in most places
    * Made use of VO:ViewOneOfN.
  * Added the various size preferences - but this needs a major
    review for more consistence and better naming.

2003/01/02
  * Renamed OneOfN to ViewOneOfN (because we will have
    a ChooseOnOfN in the future, too).

2002/12/29
  * Added OneOfN - a gadget to encapsulate visualisation of
    one out of N views depending of the number of views
    and general space requirements. It currently uses one out of
    the following visualisations:
    * VO:Tab
    * VO:Combo together with VO:Multi
    * VO:Table together with VO:Multi

2002/12/28
  * Added various variants of background for VO:Button to prefs.

2002/12/27
  * Added quickHelp attribute for all objects to VGD.

--- new release 021226

2002/12/26

--- new release 021223

2002/12/23
  * Added tool VGDView.

2002/12/19
  * VO:Base:Display.TimeOut is gone. Long live VO:Base:Display.Timer.
    See demos/Apple for example usage...
  * Added configurable timer to refreshing code. Using this timer
    refreshing event are collected until the timer runs out and then
    the destroyed parts are refreshed.
    On slow machines this reduces refreshes and may make the GUI
    more responsive and makes it use less CPU power.

2002/12/18
  * Fixed preferences handling in VO:State and dependend classes.
    VisualPrefs.Apply should now work again for assigning new images.
  * Improved look of VO:Clock.
  * Fixed wrong calculation of minWidth in VO:Combo.
  * Fixed bug in VO:DigiClock, drawing over the right end of the
    control.
  * Added VO:Dlg:Input. However, beware! The interface will change!
  * Make VO:PieChart look more 3D.
  * Added VO:PercentBar with the same interface as VO:PieChart. We
    should make a model for them...

2002/12/17
  * Fixed mouse movement handling bugs in VO:Knob and VO:Slider.
  * Fixed bugs in the ContextHelp lowlevel routines making ContextHelp
    windows not poping up.
  * Fixed bug in VO:BoolPrefs setting the image for VO:Radio instead
    of VO:Bool.
  * Fixed bug in VO:Base:DisplayPrefs, where the wrong dfont size was
    store, resulting in fotns getting larger each time the preferences
    were saved.
  * When no preferences are found, a default is automatically created.
  * Some initialisation order while laoding prefs has changed. Exspecially
    preferences are first initialized and then loaded (and overwritten).
  * A DrawInfo does not not automatically Push a font on stack. You must
    explicitely push a font know before you print out a string to the
    display.

2002/12/16
  * Make the initial font default even less restrictive by using less
    different font sizes and by removing the encoding.
  * When saving preferences, the necessary "~/.VisalOberon" directory
    is automatically created.
  * Fixed drawing code of VO:Tab.
  * Added focus chaining to VGD:Window.
  * Renamed VO:Base:Display.Window.Maped, Unmaped, Hidden, Left, etc.. to
    OnXXX.

    VO:Object.Object.VisitChildren
  * Made height of VO:Combo smaller by default.
  * Improved VO:Grid.VisitChildren
  * Removed obsolete controls VO:List and VO:Cycle together with their *Prefs
    modules. Removed also VO:Model:List.
  * Bugfix in VO:Table: Fill table area with background color, if no
    model is assigned.

2002/12/04
  * Added more functionality to VGD. Exchanged some of the examples with
    similar VGD version.

  * Added more setter methods to VO:WindowGroup for VGD.

2002/12/01
  * Added GetObjectByName TO VO:Object.Object.
  * Added missing initialisation for VO:Base:Object.MsgObject.name.
  * Added first version VDG.

2002/11/31
  * Fix a bug in VO:Model:TextView. The number of lines was not reseted to 0
    when Clear() was called.
  * Removed special home made code for "select". Now we are using the IO:Select
    implementation from the OOC-XML library.
  * Removed VO:Interface, VO:Procedure and VOLLFor.
  * Fixed a bug in VO:OS:Display, make program crash if select returned -1.
    A return value was missing.
  * Made thre functions AllocateColor8, AllocateColor16 and
    AllocateColor32 out of AllocateColor.
  * All color allocation now have the new color as VAR paramneter instead
    as a return value. This way we can define VO:Base:Display.Color as a
    RECORD without breaking code.
  * Export VO:Window.Window.top readonly.

2002/11/30
  * Added parameter visibleOnly to VO:ObjectObject.VisitChildren and
    derived classes.
  * Added VO:Base:Object.MsgObject.name and VO:Base:Object.MsgObject.SetName().
  * Fixed the various name clatches as a result of above changes.

--- new release 021129

2002/11/29
  * Change the LTableModel class.
  * Added sorting to this model.
  * Started to visualize the sorting column in VO:Header.

2002/11/29
  * Fixes to VO:Lightchain.Mod.

2002/11/02
  * Modified shortcut handling. Shortcuts are now evaluated *after* the
    object with the keyboard focus got the key event.
  * Added method Hashandler to VO:Base:Object.MsgObject. This might be
    usefull for the above change. Now you can find out if someone is
    interested in some (key) events (like "return" or "escape")
    before you catch them.

2002/11/01
  * Fixed some bugs in the menu code.

2002/10/31
  * Added preferences for VO:Tree.
  * Made some more backgrounds for various objects configurable.

  * Fixed a bug in VO:Tab, catching unwanted mosue events.

2002/10/25
  * Added VO:Object.Backgrounds for the fill area of VO:Slider and
    VO:FuelGauge. The backgrounds are configurable.

2002/10/24
  * Removed VO:Base:Background.CalcSize. VO:Image.CalcSize will be
    implicitly called by derived classes when setting the filename.
  * Removed VO:Object.Background.source. The "relative" object will now be
    handed explicitly in the VO:Object.Background.Draw() method.

2002/10/20
  * Implemented VO:Object.Visitor and VO:Object.VisitChildren.
    This allows you to iterate over the children of a layout
    object wihtout knowing it internal structure. As a consequence
    a number of methods from VO:Object.Group now moved to
    VO:Object.Layout, a number of layout object now inherit directly
    from VO:Object:Layout and a number of methods overwrite could
    be removed.
    Using this method other features like storing and printing of
    the object tree could be implemented, too.

2002/10/07
  * Fixed bug in initialisation of VO:Base:Adjustment.
  * Added range check to VO:Model:Table.SetSelection.

2002/10/04

2002/07/23
  * Enhancing VO:Multi.
  * Clean up and added functionality to VO:Dlg:File.

2002/06/04
  * Fixed problems with getting and freeing selections.
  * VO now unmapes the window then hides all controls and then
    destroys the OS window.

2002/04/14
  * Wrote new methods Push/PopBitmap for VO:Base:Display.DrawInfo, allows
    fills based on a bitmaps.
  * Created new VO:Base:Background type based on these methods.
  * Removed all object and object prefs background handling to be based
    on Background color, eliminating VO:Object.SetBackground and
    company. All background handling is now always bases on
    BackgroundObjects.
  * Changed interface of BackgroundObject prefs persistance.
  * Rewrote all object to use VO:Object.DrawBackground when possible, making
    visualisation again more flexible.
  * Enhanced button to support different backgrounds for different
    (shortcut) modi.
  * Added prefs modules for PieChart and PatternLegend.

--- new release 020310

2002/02/24
  * Improved visualisation in VO:Load a bit.
  * Added CreateHPanel and CreateVPanel to VO:Panel (for convinience).
  * Fixed layouting bug in VO:PatternLegend.

2002/02/20
  * Fixed a number of initialisation errors.

2002/02/17
  * Added VO:Dlg:Input (note that behaviour might slightly change in future).

2002/02/16
  * Renamed VO:Model:File in VO:Model:DirTable.
  * Added more functionality to Directory.Mod.
  * Added new method recatchedFocus to VO:Object.
  * Made VO:String select whiole string on focus in.

2002/01/26
  * Fixed bug in VO:Model:Table. ClearSelection didi not clealy refresh
    line.

  * Changed behaviour of VO:TableView. If model notified without
    message object, visible area is restored to top of list.

  * VO:Model:File: Merged columns for taype and size into one column.

  * Enhanced VO:Model:Table:LTableModel. Now you can insert derived ListEntries.

2002/01/23
  * Added first version in VO:Model:Table and VO:TableView for cell alignment.
    VO:Model:File make use of it.

--- new release 020122

2002/01/21
  * Added modules VO:Dlg:File, VO:Model:File, Directory.Mod and
    Directory.c for visualizing directory (so called file dialog or
    file requester). Directory.c uses some libc directory functions
    and thus may not compile on every system. Because of this it is not
    yes part of the library.

2002/01/19
  * Some fixes to VO:String. Disabled state was not always checked.
    Grid in disabled mode was not always correctly redrawn.

  * Added readOnly flag to VO:String. If set, gadget is drawn as normal
    but value cannot be manipulated.

  * Changed some key handling in VO:TableView.

  * Added GetString to VO:Model:Value.ValueModel.

2002/01/15
  * Optimized pushing and poping of fore-, background color and
    font. If attribute is already set to the requested value,
    OS will not be done. This visibly speeds up drawing.

2002/01/14
  * Removed the need for special font ids. All font operations
    directly work on VO:Base:Display.Font. Expecially definitions
    like VO:Base:Display.normalFont are not a nummeric constant
    but directly point to an instance of VO:Base:Display.Font.
    All emthods that work with font ids have been removed.

2002/01/13
  * Rewrote Display, Window and KeyEvent to use (a simple version)
    of the X11 input mechanism. GetText() and GetKey() disapeared
    and are exchanged by simple attributes.

  * Fixed a bug in VO:String, crashing when getting keyeventswithout a
    model assigned.

  * Fixed focus handling. When an object handles a mouse event it only
    gets the keyboard focus if it CanFocus().

  * VO:View removes VO:Object:canFocus from the scroller, so they do not
    catch keyboad focus (perhaps we should make this globaly configurable?).

2002/01/06
  * Fixed pattern for manupulating fontnames for font styles handling.
    VisualOberon should now be able to load more fonts.

2001/12/09
  * Fixed bug in focus chain handling. When the window opened a wrong
    gadegt was selected asinitial focus object.

  * Added new getter and CanXXX methods to VO:Model:Value to make it more
    useable.
