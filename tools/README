This are some (small) tools that ease the use of VisualOberon.

VisualPrefs

Show the current visualisation preferences and allows you to change them,
apply them for testing and store them.

VGDDoc

This tool lists all attributes an object supports in VGD.


VGDView
=======

Using this tool you can preview any VisualOberon GUI description file
(*.vgd). You can easyly test any changes to the GUI of a program
without recompilitaion of that program, without clicking through
menues and dialogs. You can check any effect on layout, windowing size
modification etc., too.
